Back in the mid-eighties the lightweight helmet was born so I decided I would 
take up cycling.  Immediately after that decision, I was further motivated by 
the prospect of touring the <I>Ice fields Parkway</I> between Banff and Jasper.  
I became a non-stop hamster on the Burke-Gilman trail and Queen Anne became my 
training hill.  I figured that if I could climb Queen Anne four times non-stop 
(a gain of 500 feet each time) that I would be ready for the mountain passes 
in the Canadian Rockies.  Amazingly, it worked.   Since then I’ve stayed local 
with my rides, completing STP four times--once in one day.  It’s been a few years 
since I’ve cycled regularly.  One misty morning a few months back, I decided 
to give it a try again.  I accidentally hooked up with an SBC ride to Edmonds.  
I had a good time and it felt great to be on my bike.  I’m looking forward to 
regular cycling, this time with a focus on SBC weekend tours.  But I’ve made 
a hotel reservation for STP as well!

After joining, I came regularly to the monthly potlucks and enjoyed meeting other 
members.  The speakers were excellent and I always had a good time.  Shortly, 
someone nominated me for President and here I am.  I’ve never been involved in 
a club in this manner and I’m glad it’s SBC.  The people are enthusiastic, smart, 
and very supportive.  I think it’s a great club and hope to have lots of people 
join in the fun.
