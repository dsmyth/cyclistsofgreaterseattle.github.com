Lynnwood resident.<BR> 
Boeing Employee for 18 years.<BR>
Grew up racing BMX and playing golf.

<P>
Three years ago I hurt my shoulder so since I could not play golf, I was challenged 
by a friend to do the STP. I had a mountain bike for many years but I was never 
serious about long rides so I took on the challenge and purchased a Trek road bike 
and I have not stopped since. Yes I did the STP and have done it since along with 
other long distance rides. I got hooked to a point that even after my rehab I have 
not touched my golf clubs. I try to go up to Mt Rainier once a year as an excuse to 
practice for RAMROD but I have not been able to get in yet. Maybe 2004 will be the 
year.

<P>
I have been a volunteer for the Cascade Bicycle Club for the main events including 
the Bike Expo. Two years ago I met Jim Eanes while I was working in the Expo and he 
told me all about the Seattle Bicycle Club so I looked it up on the web and found it 
interesting. I really liked their jersey but found out that to get a jersey, I had 
to join the club. Well, I did and that has been a great experience. Even though I 
have not been able to do as many rides with the team I have managed to volunteer to 
work with the merchandise and in a very limited way helping Karin with the newsletter.

<P>
What a great group of people to meet and to work with on a great sport.
