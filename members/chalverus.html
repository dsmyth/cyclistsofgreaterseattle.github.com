Joe has lived in the Lake City area of Seattle for over twenty years. He works as a lawyer 
and has his own law practice in the Lake City area of Seattle. He raised his three children 
as a single parent and still loves kids. When his children finally left the nest, he 
discovered bicycling and that summer is not the time to leave Seattle on vacation. He does 
the STP and RSVP every year and looks forward to more challenging rides.

<P>
Joe also leads a variety of rides for Seattle Bicycle Club including the solstice rides, 
first Thursday of the month art-walk ride series with co-leader Jennifer, the ride to Port 
Orchard, Watch the Salmon turn Red up the Cedar river ride and a variety of rides relating 
to activities around the City such as art fairs, food fairs and the like. He likes to ride 
high-social to low moderate with groups and high moderate when alone.

<P>
Because he is so serious at work, he becomes a jokester at play, particularly when riding 
his bike.
