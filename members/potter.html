My eventual, and at the time unlikely, development as a cyclist started in my 
stomping grounds of East Greenlake in Seattle, with a small coaster break K-Mart 
special with training wheels.  I spent many days of my youth in the Greenlake 
neighborhood of Seattle with my Dad teaching me how to ride, attempting to convince 
me to ride without training wheels. After time, I eventually (reluctantly) did wean 
myself from training wheels.  I then graduated to my first “real” bike when I was 
12: a used 1970’s yellow Schwinn Sting Ray 5 Speed.  I road that for several years, 
until I kept getting left behind my friends with their 10 speeds. My parents then 
gave me a Huffy 10-speed so I could keep up with my friends.  

<P>
It was with the Huffy that I found the love of bicycling.  Some college friends 
during my senior year at Seattle University organized daylong trips from SU to 
Chateau St. Michelle and back again.  Though my friends with their high-tech (at 
the time) mountain bikes left me behind sucking air, the rides were so fun that I 
was hooked. After graduation, I bought a new bike, and became a hard core bicycling 
commuter and fitness rider.  I bicycled everywhere despite bad weather and hills, 
relishing the health and fitness I gained (as well as the money I saved) from biking 
instead of driving a car.  I still to this day do not have my driver’s license (a 
mixture of philosophical and economic reasons).  And while I still attempt to brave 
the elements, I have to admit that recently I am more likely to scurry to the bus or 
bum a ride in a car in the face of inclement weather.

<P>
During the past 14 years as a committed cyclist in the Seattle area, I have been 
involved with the Cascade Bicycle Club, the Seattle Bicycle Advisory Board, and 
the Bicycle Alliance of Washington (NOWBike at the time I started volunteering).  
I joined the Seattle Bicycle Club in late 2001, and have enjoyed meeting, riding 
with and socializing with the members of our friendly club.

As an incoming SBC board member, I want strengthen club marketing in the Seattle 
area, to increase club membership, and to strengthen our relationships with other 
cycling clubs and organizations in the area. I ultimately want to do what I can to 
make sure that the club has a fun and successful year!  

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#150567"><B></B></FONT>
My personal goals are to ride my bike more this year!  I want to challenge myself/be 
challenged to do longer rides, as I never have ridden a century or a tour – so maybe 
RAMROD this year? STP?  RAPSody?

<P>
You will also often see me torn between my love of cycling and my love of running - 
I have been a runner since high school (sprints then, marathons now).   Last year 
(2004) I had a very successful year of running, bettering times that I had made over 
10 years ago, as well as establishing several Personal Records.  This year among my 
running goals is to qualify for the Boston Marathon.  My other goals include bettering 
my times in several other distances/races as well, and maybe even attempt a sprint 
triathlon (if I can get that swimming thing together past a dog paddle).  So you 
multi-sport members out there, I understand how tough it is to decide which groups 
you will or will not be running/biking with each week.
