Urania Perez has been 
bike commuting to work since 1996. She started first with the bike-to-work 
event, then every Friday and then she got addicted to be in contact with 
nature on the Burke Gilman Trail and being able to both commute by bike 
and exercise all at the same time. 

<P>
Currently, Urania rides every day from Wedgwood to the Key Tower where she
is employed by the City of Seattle as an environmental analyst.

<P>
Urania enjoys assisting other new bike commuters to determine what is the 
best route, gear to wear in the rain, lights, etc. She also has volunteered 
before with both the Seattle Bicycle Club and Cascade Bike Club. Contact her 
with questions about commuting.
