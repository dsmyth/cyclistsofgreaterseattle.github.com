I didn’t begin biking until about 15 years ago and then only at the insistence 
of a friend. Found out I loved it and wanted to bike everywhere. So I started 
planning weekend tours for friends around the area. When that wasn’t enough to 
satisfy my touring desire I signed up for weeklong tours with Cycle America and 
most recently Tour BC. In fact, I joined Seattle Bike Club so I could participate 
in the touring weekend that was held at Birch Bay.<BR> 

<P>
You probably won’t see me on many rides in the winter, as I am not much of a 
winter biker. I like to spend my winter weekends in the mountains cross-country 
skiing or snow shoeing.

I have been a ride leader and in charge of the kitchen for the potluck at the 
monthly meetings. I have organized one weekend tour for the club and hope to 
organize many more this year as the tour coordinator. If you would like to help 
with the tours or have any suggestions for tours please email me.
