"My first bike was a single speed in second grade. Back then I used it to commute to school 
even got busted for riding it on school grounds. I still do not agree with the conviction. 
The arresting teacher had a loose interpretation of the rules in my opinion. Next was a three 
speed for a junior high paper route. That bike lasted through high school."

"I didn't ride in college; walking fit the bill for the most part. My current bike is 
a reasonably nice Cannondale road bike that gets me around pretty well, although I also 
have a mountain bike. Now biking is my primary hobby, along with cross-country skiing 
in the winter, when we have one."

Along with being the club Ride Director, Mark has been instrumental at the Seattle
Bicycle Club in <FONT COLOR="#150567"><B>encouraging more interaction with other 
area clubs</B></FONT>.  He has a nice relaxed style about him that serves both himself 
and the club well.  While Mark usually leads moderate rides, he is a strong cyclist 
and doesn't flinch at even the toughest challenges as was evident last year when 
he rode Pedal the Peaks in Wyoming and Montana.
