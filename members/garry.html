      <br>
I began biking in 1997 as a means of getting some much needed
exercise.&nbsp; Shortly after purchasing a bicycle, I began commuting
18 miles a day (round trip) to work in Spokane.&nbsp; In September of
1998, I rode my first century and in 1999 rode from Seattle to Spokane
with my son, Dirk. <br>
      <br>
I returned to Seattle from Spokane in 2001; continuing to ride solo
throughout the Seattle area.&nbsp; In early 2004, I looked up SBC on
the Web and began weekend rides and found the joy of group
riding.&nbsp; Since then I have enjoyed biking as an SBC member to
include training rides for Ramrod &#8230; which I was able to ride in 2005.<br>

Volunteering</span><br>
      <br>
Jimmy Pelaez asked me to work with him on the SBC board in 2005.&nbsp;
This is my first endeavor as a club volunteer and am enjoying the work
and the camaraderie that comes working with other committed cyclists. <br>
