Unlike many of my esteemed colleagues in the Seattle Bicycle Club, 
I am relatively new to biking.  Usually I'm out hiking in the mountains 
or running along the Burke Gilman trail.  But at the wee tender age of 30 
I bought my first 'adult' bicycle for two reasons:  (1) I wanted to do 
a local multi-sport adventure race, which included a mountain biking leg, 
and (2) I wanted to do the STP.  The only problem was that I'd only ridden 
on a bicycle perhaps 3 or 4 times since childhood.  So I bought an 
inexpensive Cannondale hybrid and started training.  Enter the Seattle 
Bicycle Club -- a great place for someone who is new to cycling to learn 
the ropes, go on fun rides, and meet terrific people at the same time.   
I've accomplished both of my original biking goals, but somewhere in the 
process I found I really love this new sport, so I plan to continue riding 
with and supporting the SBC for a long time to come.

Shortly after joining SBC, the call came out for a new newsletter editor.  
I'd actually contemplated editing as a career choice at one time, despite 
never having officially edited anything in my life.  So I couldn't resist 
the temptation to volunteer for this position, and I've enjoyed it even 
more than I would have imagined.  I'm always looking for new material for 
the newsletter, so send your ideas to 
<I>articles @ seattlebicycle.com</I>!
