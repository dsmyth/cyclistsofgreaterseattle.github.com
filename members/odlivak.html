Victor was actually obsessed with bicycles long before this incarnation. 

<P>
In fact as Klaus Seckel in the Netherlands who wrote a diary, <I>Der Taegesbuch 
der Klaus Seckel</I> there is an intimate description of him changing a flat tire 
one day.  

<P>
"Since 1985 my only vehicles have been bicycles, though I have been known 
to use Taxi's and take rides from friends. Any bike in any form is beautiful, 
from recumbent to Moulton to mountain bike to a Brompton folder. Yes I have 
had all these and more. I enjoy leading <FONT COLOR="#150567"><B>rides that 
are sociable and involve a lot of eating and getting to know the local 
culture</B></FONT>. The last ride I led took 13 days and 550 km in Cuba. So 
remember Compañeros as riding a bicycle is a revolutionary act, and the 
revolution will not be televized!"  <I><FONT COLOR="#150567">- Victor -</FONT></I>

<P>
Since the club opened in 1998, Victor has been the unofficial Director of
Postal Services stopping at the Post Office each week to pick up the club mail.  
Officially this year Victor is the Membership Coordinator and assists by 
maintaining the membership database and welcoming new members.  While Victor is
a very strong cyclist he prefers to cycle at a slower pace and has quite a
following on his leisure/social rides that are <FONT COLOR="#150567"><B>much 
more fun than exercise</B></FONT>.
