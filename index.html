					<p>
						C.O.G.S. is a Seattle Area cycling club with great rides, fun people and social events. We&nbsp; offer terrific bike riding opportunities
						through out the year. C.O.G.S. is distinguished from other clubs in how we develop camaraderie and friendships through biking. This
						includes social events with a focus on cycling and good
						times. With about 120 members, we are small enough to get to know one another through
						rides and social activities. Become a member of C.O.G.S. and you will gain friends, get fit, become a better cyclist and enjoy being outdoors in the beautiful Pacific Northwest.
