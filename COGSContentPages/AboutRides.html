<p style="text-align: center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Responding to requests of club members, the COGS sponsors a series of rides that cover the range from the
	occasional Saturday outing up to preparation for&nbsp;an ambitious mountain
	tour. We have brought back the rides that were successful in the past
	and added some new ones. All rides will be posted on the COGS web site,
	so check regularly for updates.

<h2>Weekly Gasworks Rides - Wednesday Evenings. </h2>

<h2>Weekend Rides </h2>
<p>We have a number of riders who enjoy leading rides in our local area.
	These are typically 40 to 70 miles at a moderate or brisk pace or
	some combination of moderate to brisk. They follow scenic rural
	routes in King and neighboring counties usually within an hourÂ’s
	drive from Seattle. These rides offer a way to log more mileage and
	see new roads with a compatible group of COGS riders. Usually a lunch
	stop is included. Expect to see these rides posted a week or two
	ahead of time on the COGS web site at the Upcoming Rides page, led by
	Bob Nyberg, Louise Kornreich, Mark Peterson, Gary Strauss and others.

<h2>COGS Training series </h2>
<p>This popular series for those with ambitious riding goals is back this
	year. A comprehensive series of training rides held each Saturday
	from mid March through August. The series adds miles and altitude as
	the season progresses to help you prepare for a one-day STP, RAMROD
	or similar challenges. The series includes our own club rides such as
	Seabeck, La Conner-Mt Erie, Ride Around Hood Canal, Blewett Pass,
	Snoqualmie Pass, Hurricane Ridge, and Sunrise, Paradise and other
	Hills of MT Rainier, and mixes in COGS-lead groups participating at
	sponsored events such as the Yakima Ridges Ride, Flying Wheels, Tour

		Bay in July</strong> and the <strong>San Juan Islands in August</strong>. The
	multi-day outings emphasize camaraderie as much as cycling. They are
