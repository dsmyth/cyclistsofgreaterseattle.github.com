<strong>Ride Description:&nbsp; </strong>A training ride from West Seattle, scheduled for evenings during the spring, summer and fall, 'between the vernal and autumnal equinox'. There are no cue sheets, we regroup often at major turns in the routes, so not to leave someone behind lost in a neighborhood that they maybe unfamiliar with. We do not ride pacelines and we are not a stay together ride either, however we all do ride at a similar pace and therefore we do stay together most of the time. Most of the riders who ride know the routes and are welcome to go off the front and have as much fun as they care to.&nbsp; Be prepared to handle your minor mechanical problems, flat tires etc. Lights are recommended but not required.&nbsp; We will try to&nbsp; finish before dark. Bring sufficient drinks and extra food for a two to three hour ride.<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Helvetica"></span>

<p><strike><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>Description: </strong>The ride this weekend is up
beautiful Mount Baker. We depart from the
little community of Glacier and climb about 30 miles and about 5000 feet. There
are three really great parts to the ride. The first is the climb up Mt Baker Highway…one
of the best mountain climbs in the Pacific Northwest-
good road and usually not much traffic. The scenery is to die for!! The second
best part is arriving at Artist Point at the end of the road. The vistas are
nothing short of magnificent!! The third best part is the down hill
descent—WOW!!.</font></strike></p>
<p><strike><font size="3" face="Arial">Car pooling is strongly
encouraged. If you need help arranging use the COGS email to solicit help from
others. If you can give a ride please let it be known.</font></strike></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Saturday August 22 and Sunday, August 23, 2009 <strong>RAPSODY - Ride Around Puget Sound<br />
</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>The RIDE</strong>: </font>This is the premier ride around the Puget Sound including crossing the new Tacoma Narrows
 Bridge and traveling
through five different counties on country roads and bikeways.&nbsp; It also
includes a night of camaraderie, food, drink, live music and general merriment
in downtown metropolitan Shelton.
The route is about 170 miles with elevation to challenge us all. We will do the
ride in two days and camp free at the Shelton High School.
The first day we will bike 89 miles and climb 5800 feet and on the second day
we will bike 81 miles and climb 3800 feet. Check out the route at <a href="http://www.rapsodybikeride.com/route.html" target="_blank">http://www.rapsodybikeride.
<wbr />com/route.html</a></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>When</strong>:&nbsp;</font> August 22<sup>nd</sup>
and 23<sup>rd</sup> which is a Saturday/Sunday weekend. <u>Plan is to meet at
7:30 AM and depart shortly thereafter.</u> Plan is to ride more or less
together as a group of friends regrouping at all the delicious food and
watering stops planned for our enjoyment along the way. Of course, you can also
start out with the group and “hammer” ahead if you so desire.
Another possibility is that smaller groups of like minded riders will elect to
ride together. Whatever, we will all enjoy each others company in Shelton Saturday evening. </p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>Logistics</strong>: </font>There is
a bit of logistics associated with doing this ride. First you must register for
the ride. You can do that at <a href="http://www.rapsodybikeride.com/register.html" target="_blank">http://www.rapsodybikeride.
<wbr />com/register.html</a>
Register prior to July 18<sup>th</sup> and the cost is $80. Register after July
18<sup>th</sup> the cost is $90. Members of Bicycle Alliance save an additional
$10.&nbsp; </p>
<p>You will need to bring your camping gear and drop at the starting point.&nbsp; Luggage transportation to Shelton and back to start are included in the registration fee.&nbsp; REad the registration info and ensure you have all the logistic bases covered.&nbsp; Free parking is provided for our cars. </p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>Why</strong>: </font>There are two
reasons. The first is the ride is awesome. It is a must do ride. It is
beautiful ride in parts of Washington
many of us rarely have the opportunity to experience. Everyone that has ever
done the ride says “great ride” , “terrific ride”,
“I would do it again”! The second reason is all the proceeds from
the ride go to the Bike Alliance of Washington. The ride is sponsored and
hosted by 5 small bike clubs, <span class="il">COGS</span> being one of them. Our Bob Nyberg and others
have put countless hours into preparing this ride for us and to help raise
funds to support the Bike Alliance of Washington.</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>Ride Leader</strong>: Tom Tanner or self-lead.&nbsp; The ride is supported.</font></p>
