<strong>Meet At:</strong> <font color="#660000"><strong><span style="color: #7e0517">6:15 pm, start 6:30pm sharp</span></strong>.<br />
</font></span></font><strong>Brisk Paced Ride Group:</strong> Brisk pace is 16 to 18 + MPH on the flats and potentially steep<br />
hills.<br />
<strong>Moderate Paced Ride Group:</strong> Moderate pace is 14 to 16 MPH on the flats with moderate<br />
hill climbs.<br />
<strong>Ride Distance:</strong> Moderate paced group will generally ride 20 to 25 miles in length with the brisk<br />
paced ride group doing 20-35 miles.<br />
<strong>Ride Terrain:</strong> Mixed / Hilly. Brisk riders will endeavor to take on more challenging terrain than the<br />
moderate paced riders.<br />
<strong>Ride Leaders:</strong> Ride leaders will vary over the season and be made up of volunteers willing to<br />
lead the rides. Volunteer ride leaders are always welcome!<br />
<strong>Ride Coordinators:</strong> Brain Anderson (home phone: 206/283-4913 and cell: 206/909-6367) is the<br />
Brisk Paced ride coordinator and Tom Tanner (home: 206/298-0225 and cell: 206/384-9400) is<br />
the Moderate Paced ride coordinator.<br />
<strong>Rain Policy:</strong> Heavy rain cancels.<br />
<strong>Ride Description:</strong> This is a mid-week training ride for those who live or work in Seattle. We will<br />
vary the routes from week to week and sample Seattle neighborhoods, parks and waterfronts. We<br />
will climb at least one or two hills to strengthen our lungs and legs, but the ultimate goal will be to<br />
help each other stay active, have fun and enjoy each others company.<br />
Stay Together Rides: Both paced rides are stay together rides. The ride leaders will endeavor to<br />
keep the groups together and/or at least regroup occasionally as the ride progresses.<br />
Social Happening: There will be an optional get-together at the establishment of our choice after<br />
each ride. The brisk and moderate riders will generally try to meet up at the same location for the<br />
optional social time together. Ride Leaders will announce the location of the social gathering prior<br />
to the end of the ride.<br />
Necessary Equipment: front and back night lights are a must for these rides as the rides finish<br />
after dusk!!</div>
