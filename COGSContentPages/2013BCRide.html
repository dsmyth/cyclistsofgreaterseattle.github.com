<p>COGS is offering a beautiful eight day bike tour from Eastern Washington into British Columbia, Canada and back. This &nbsp;promises to be a fun-filled and adventuresome COGS tour. To participate, you will need to act quickly to reserve a spot on the trip.</p>
<p>COGS has arranged for Ralph and Carol Nussbaum &ndash; long time COGS members, who for the past 12 years have been organizing and leading professional bike tours as volunteers around the country - to coordinate and lead the ride. Ralph and Carol have agreed to organize and lead this &nbsp;8 day tour exclusively for COGS members &ldquo;at cost&rdquo;. They will be our ride leaders and will make all the tour arrangements including providing cue sheets and maps for each day along with lots of ideas of interesting things in route including a stop at Ainsworth Hot Springs.</p>
<p>This Washington (WA) &ndash; British Columbia (BC) 8 day tour is 430 miles in length. &nbsp;Starting in the mining town of Republic in Eastern Washington, we will quickly travel into British Columbia, paralleling the Columbia River and Roosevelt Lake in BC and going as far north as Kaslo in Canada. The route includes one sizable mountain pass, a big hill and lots of smaller hills while traveling along beautiful valleys, quiet roads and nearly unspoiled lakes. More information on the tour is available on the COGS website including a day by day description of the tour along with a great map showing the entire route.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The ride is intended for riders with moderately high biking skill levels or better. Everyone can ride at their own comfortable pace. Be aware though that there are two 90 mile days and we will be climbing 4,000 &ndash; 5,000&rsquo; every day. There will be a day off in Kaslo. The trip will be supported with a dedicated SAG van and a support truck to haul all of our stuff. If you&rsquo;re having an off day or have a mechanical you can always catch a ride in the SAG van. The cost of the tour includes the SAG truck and van as well as motel lodging, snacks and lunch along the way. No camping needed on this trip! Breakfast and dinner are on our own with several motels throwing in breakfast at no additional cost.</p>
<p>The ride is open to COGS members and COGS friends. The ride will be limited to the first 28 riders that sign up. The plan is to fill the tour with COGS riders and their friends. <font face="wp_bogus_font">However, if the tour is not full (28 paid up riders) as of February 10th the tour will be opened to non - COGS riders </font>to fill up the tour to ensure all the fixed costs are covered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The cost of the trip is $950 per participant. This includes the cost of the per diem for the ride leaders and SAG drivers, motels, vehicle support, snacks/lunch and other miscellaneous costs associated with organizing and fielding the trip. 25% ($240) of the cost for each rider will be collected at time of registration and the remainder is due 60 days prior to the event ($710 due NLT than April 29th). See the COGS website for information on refunds for this tour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;All participants will need to be or become COGS members so that COGS insurance covers everyone on the ride. If you are not a COGS member you must submit an application to join COGS with the annual club dues of $16 when you submit your application and deposit for the ride.</p>
