<h1 style="text-align: center;"> COGS 7 Day Cycling Tour of the Idaho
    Panhandle </h1>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Saturday to Saturday – August 16th to
    August 23rd 2014</h2>

<p>COGS is offering a beautiful seven day bike tour in the Panhandle
    region of Idaho starting and finishing in Coeur d’Alene, Idaho from
    August 16th to 23rd, 2014. This promises to be a fun-filled and
    adventuresome COGS bike tour.</p>

<br>

<p>Recall that Carol and Ralph Nussbaum led a very successful tour from
    Eastern Washington into British Columbia and back this past June for
    our club. COGS has again requested Ralph and Carol – long time COGS
    members, who for the past 12 years have been organizing and leading
    professional bike tours as volunteers around the country - to
    coordinate and lead the Idaho ride. They have agreed to do so "at
    cost". They will be our ride leaders and will make all the tour
    arrangements including providing cue sheets and maps for each day along
    with lots of ideas for interesting things to do en route.</p>

<br>

<p>This seven day Idaho tour is 375 miles in length and has something
    for everyone, tremendous variety in scenery, mountain passes, lakes and
    streams, plentiful opportunities for sighting wildlife and two
    beautiful paved trail systems. The route starts and ends in Coeur
    d'Alene and travels north on quiet back roads along Hayden Lake
    (perhaps named after a long lost relative of our Mike Hayden?) to
    Sandpoint, ID. Route follows Lake Pend Oreille and Clark Fork River
    into Montana and then heads southwest over Thompson and Dobson Passes
    to the historic mining town of Wallace, ID where we will spend a rest
    day. For an additional $75, many folks will want to rent mountain bikes
    and ride the Trail of the Hiawatha along the old Great Northern
    Railroad bed. We then follow the spectacular Trail of the Coeur
    d’Alenes to Harrison, ID. The following day we enter Washington and
    ride north to Spokane, where we pick up the Centennial Trail back to
    Coeur d’Alene.</p>

<br>

<p> The ride is intended for riders with moderately high biking skill
    levels or better. Everyone can ride at their own comfortable pace. Be
    aware though that there are two 80 mile days and we will be climbing
    3,000' – 5,000' on three days. There will be a day off in Wallace. The
    trip will be supported with a dedicated SAG van and a support truck to
    haul all of our stuff. If you’re having an off day or have a mechanical
    you can always catch a ride in the SAG van. The cost of the tour
    includes the SAG truck and van as well as motel lodging, snacks and
    lunch along the way. No camping needed on this trip! Breakfast and
    dinner are on our own with several motels throwing in breakfast at no
    additional cost.</p>

<br>

<p> The ride is open to COGS members and COGS friends. The ride will be
    limited to the first 30 riders that sign up. The plan is to fill the
    tour with COGS riders and their friends. However, if the tour is not
    full (30 paid up riders) as of January 15th the tour will be opened to
    non - COGS riders to fill up the tour to ensure all the fixed costs are
    covered.</p>

<br>

<p> The cost of the trip is $825 per participant (plus an additional
    $75 if you want to rent the mountain bike and ride the Trail of the
    Hiawatha. This includes the cost of the per diem for the ride leaders
    and SAG drivers, motels, vehicle support, snacks/lunch and other
    miscellaneous costs associated with organizing and fielding the trip.
    25% ($225) of the cost for each rider will be collected at time of
    registration and the remainder is due 90 days prior to the event ($600
    due no later than May 15th). Go <a title="COGS Tour Refund Policy" target="_blank"

    to see the COGS Refund/Transfer Policy.</p>

<br>

<p> All participants will need to be or become COGS members so that
    COGS insurance covers everyone on the ride. If you are not a COGS
    member you must submit an application to join COGS with the annual club
    dues of $16 when you submit your application and deposit for the ride.</p>
