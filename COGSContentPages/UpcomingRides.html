<h3><font color="#990000">Gasworks Wednesday Evening Rides: The Fall and Winter Riding Series</font></h3>
<h4>
	There is now a Moderate Paced ride group leaving at the same time. Come and join the ride!</h4> <br />
<strong>Ride Days: Wednesday Evenings. </strong><br />
<strong>Ride Start: Gasworks Park, Seattle.</strong><br />
<strong>Meet At:</strong>6:15 pm, start 6:30pm sharp.<br />
<strong>Brisk/Strenuous Paced Ride Group:</strong> Pace varies with weather and route from 16 to 20+ MPH on flats with potentially steep hills. Ride pace is usually in the upper pace range.<br />
<strong>Moderate Paced Ride Group:</strong> Moderate pace is 14 to 16 MPH on the flats with moderate hill climbs.<br />
<strong>Ride Distance:</strong> Moderate paced group will generally ride 20 to 25 miles in length with the brisk/strenuous paced ride group doing 20-35 miles.<br />
<strong>Ride Terrain:</strong> Mixed / Hilly. Brisk/strenuous riders will endeavor to take on more challenging terrain than the moderate paced riders.<br />
<strong>Ride Leaders:</strong> Ride leaders will vary over the season and be made up of volunteers willing to lead the rides. Volunteer ride leaders are always welcome!<br />
<strong>Ride Coordinators:</strong> Brian Anderson (home phone: 425-712-7125 and cell: 206/909-6367) is the Brisk/Strenuous Paced ride coordinator and Tom Tanner (home: 206/298-0225 and cell: 206/384-9400) is the Moderate Paced ride coordinator.<br />
<strong>Rain Policy:</strong> Heavy rain cancels.<br />
<strong>Ride Description:</strong><br />
This is a mid-week training ride for those who live or work in Seattle. We will vary the routes from week to week and sample Seattle neighborhoods, parks and waterfronts. We will climb at least one or two hills to strengthen our lungs and legs, but the ultimate goal will be to help each other stay active, have fun and enjoy each others company. Stay Together Rides: Both paced rides are stay together rides. The ride leaders will endeavor to keep the groups together and/or at least regroup occasionally as the ride progresses. Social Happening: There will be an optional get-together at the establishment of our choice after each ride. The riders from both groups will generally try to meet up at the same location for the optional social time together. Ride Leaders will announce the location of the social gathering prior
to the end of the ride. Necessary Equipment: front and back night lights are a must for these rides as the rides finish after dusk!!<br />

</div>
<p>Meet: 9:00 at Linear Park (on Burnett Street across from The Red House) in Renton for carpooling.  Or 9:45 at Orting High School, in Orting.
</p>
<p>The last 6 miles is an unpaved  park road so you should be prepared for that type of road and  adventure.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
	25c or 28c touring tires are probably worthwhile. so leave the racing  tires at home. <br />
