<h3><font color="#990000">Over and Under Snoqualmie Pass Ride, July 20 2013</font></h3>

<font style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Start:&nbsp;
Twin Falls trailhead off exit 38, I-90&nbsp; (Discover Pass required)<br>
Time:&nbsp; 9:30&nbsp; am<br>
Ride Leader: Mark Peterson<br>
Pace/Distance: Moderate. ~ 40 miles<br>
Terrain:&nbsp; More or less one big hill.<br>
Cue Sheet/Map: Yes<br>
<br>
Sensible riders,<br>
<br>
Are you tired of being passed by snobby cyclists that sneer as they
ride by on their uber-light,<br>
skinny-tired carbon or titanium bikes?&nbsp; This ride is for you,
hybrid or mountain bike required.&nbsp; Well,<br>
I suppose a road bike could work, but it would be really
uncomfortable.&nbsp; Let 'em keep their skinny<br>
tires on the pavement.&nbsp; I've ridden this on 700 x 35 tires and
would not want to go too much smaller.<br>
<br>
The ride:&nbsp;&nbsp; Driving eastbound on I-90, take exit 38 and turn
right.&nbsp; Cross the bridge and turn<br>
right into the Twin Falls trailhead.&nbsp; A Discover Pass is required
to park here.&nbsp; The last time I was<br>
there, a dropbox was available so that a one day pass could be
purchased on the spot.&nbsp; However,<br>
that was last year.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
From the trailhead the ride goes along the frontage road then joins
I-90 for exactly one mile.&nbsp; We'll<br>
leave I-90 at the Tinkham road exit, ride 5 miles of gravel until
crossing I-90 to pick up the Denny<br>
Creek road to the top of Snoqualmie Pass.&nbsp; Next follow the
frontage road past the ski areas to <br>
the Hyak Sno-Park.&nbsp; Bring or buy lunch to eat at the picnic tables
here.&nbsp; Next we'll head through the<br>
Snoqualmie Tunnel on the John Wayne trail back to the trailhead.<br>
<br>
The tunnel is 2.2 miles long and very dark.&nbsp; Bring a really good
light.<br>
<br>

<h3><font color="#990000">Tour de Kitsap, Sunday, July 28 2013</font></h3>
<font style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">COGS will be
organizing a group of interested COGS riders (and their friends) to
participate in the Tour De Kitsap Bike Tour on Sunday, July 28th.&nbsp;
This is a heads up about the ride and a suggestion that you mark your
calendar to save the date. COGS riders will take the Bremerton Ferry
from Coleman Dock to Bremerton to participate in the ride event. COGS
will post the ride by email when the event gets closer so you will know
which ferry to catch to ride with your COGS friends.<br>
&nbsp;<br>

</ul>

schedule permits.<br>

<h3><font color="#990000">Gasworks Wednesday Evening Rides: The Fall

<h4> There is now a Moderate Paced ride group leaving at the same time.
Come and join the ride!</h4>
<br>
<strong>Ride Days: Wednesday Evenings. </strong><br>
<strong>Ride Start: Gasworks Park, Seattle.</strong><br>
<strong>Meet At:</strong>6:15 pm, start 6:30pm sharp.<br>
<strong>Brisk/Strenuous Paced Ride Group:</strong> Pace varies with
weather and route from 16 to 20+ MPH on flats with potentially steep
hills. Ride pace is usually in the upper pace range.<br>
<strong>Moderate Paced Ride Group:</strong> Moderate pace is 14 to 16
MPH on the flats with moderate hill climbs.<br>
<strong>Ride Distance:</strong> Moderate paced group will generally
ride 20 to 25 miles in length with the brisk/strenuous paced ride group
doing 20-35 miles.<br>
<strong>Ride Terrain:</strong> Mixed / Hilly. Brisk/strenuous riders
will endeavor to take on more challenging terrain than the moderate
paced riders.<br>
<strong>Ride Leaders:</strong> Ride leaders will vary over the season
and be made up of volunteers willing to lead the rides. Volunteer ride
leaders are always welcome!<br>
<strong>Ride Coordinators:</strong> Brian Anderson (home phone:
425-712-7125 and cell: 206/909-6367) is the Brisk/Strenuous Paced ride
coordinator and Tom Tanner (home: 206/298-0225 and cell: 206/384-9400)
is the Moderate Paced ride coordinator.<br>
<strong>Rain Policy:</strong> Heavy rain cancels.<br>
<strong>Ride Description:</strong><br>
This is a mid-week training ride for those who live or work in Seattle.
We will vary the routes from week to week and sample Seattle
neighborhoods, parks and waterfronts. We will climb at least one or two
hills to strengthen our lungs and legs, but the ultimate goal will be
to help each other stay active, have fun and enjoy each others company.
Stay Together Rides: Both paced rides are stay together rides. The ride
leaders will endeavor to keep the groups together and/or at least
regroup occasionally as the ride progresses. Social Happening: There
will be an optional get-together at the establishment of our choice
after each ride. The riders from both groups will generally try to meet
up at the same location for the optional social time together. Ride
Leaders will announce the location of the social gathering prior
to the end of the ride. Necessary Equipment: front and back night
lights are a must for these rides as the rides finish after dusk!!<br>
<br>
