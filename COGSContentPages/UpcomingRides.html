<h3><font color="#990000">Gasworks Wednesday Evening Rides: The Fall
    and Winter Riding Series</font></h3>
<h4> There is now a Moderate Paced ride group leaving at the same time.
    Come and join the ride!</h4>
<br>
<strong>Ride Days: Wednesday Evenings. </strong><br>
<strong>Ride Start: Gasworks Park, Seattle.</strong><br>
<strong>Meet At:</strong> 6:15 pm, start 6:30pm sharp.<br>
<strong>Brisk/Strenuous Paced Ride Group:</strong> Pace varies with
weather and route from 16 to 20+ MPH on flats with potentially steep
hills. Ride pace is usually in the upper pace range.<br>
<strong>Moderate Paced Ride Group:</strong> Moderate pace is 14 to 16
MPH on the flats with moderate hill climbs.<br>
<strong>Ride Distance:</strong> Moderate paced group will generally
ride 20 to 25 miles in length with the brisk/strenuous paced ride group
doing 20-35 miles.<br>
<strong>Ride Terrain:</strong> Mixed / Hilly. Brisk/strenuous riders
will endeavor to take on more challenging terrain than the moderate
paced riders.<br>
<strong>Ride Leaders:</strong> Ride leaders will vary over the season
and be made up of volunteers willing to lead the rides. Volunteer ride
leaders are always welcome!<br>
<strong>Ride Coordinators:</strong> Brian Anderson (home phone:
425-712-7125 and cell: 206/909-6367) is the Brisk/Strenuous Paced ride
coordinator and Tom Tanner (home: 206/298-0225 and cell: 206/384-9400)
is the Moderate Paced ride coordinator.<br>
<strong>Rain Policy:</strong> Heavy rain cancels.<br>
<strong>Ride Description:</strong><br>
This is a mid-week training ride for those who live or work in Seattle.
We will vary the routes from week to week and sample Seattle
neighborhoods, parks and waterfronts. We will climb at least one or two
hills to strengthen our lungs and legs, but the ultimate goal will be
to help each other stay active, have fun and enjoy each others company.
Stay Together Rides: Both paced rides are stay together rides. The ride
leaders will endeavor to keep the groups together and/or at least
regroup occasionally as the ride progresses. Social Happening: There
will be an optional get-together at the establishment of our choice
after each ride. The riders from both groups will generally try to meet
up at the same location for the optional social time together. Ride
Leaders will announce the location of the social gathering prior
to the end of the ride. Necessary Equipment: front and back night
lights are a must for these rides as the rides finish after dusk!!<br>
