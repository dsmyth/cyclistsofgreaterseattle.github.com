<strong>Ride Coordinators:</strong> Brian Anderson (home phone:

<strong>Rain Policy:</strong> Heavy rain cancels.<br>
<strong>Ride Description:</strong><br>
This is a mid-week training ride for those who live or work in Seattle.
We will vary the routes from week to week and sample Seattle
neighborhoods, parks and waterfronts. We will climb at least one or two
hills to strengthen our lungs and legs, but the ultimate goal will be
to help each other stay active, have fun and enjoy each others company.
Stay Together Rides: Both paced rides are stay together rides. The ride
leaders will endeavor to keep the groups together and/or at least
regroup occasionally as the ride progresses. Social Happening: There
will be an optional get-together at the establishment of our choice
after each ride. The riders from both groups will generally try to meet
up at the same location for the optional social time together. Ride
Leaders will announce the location of the social gathering prior
to the end of the ride. Necessary Equipment: front and back night
lights are a must for these rides as the rides finish after dusk!!<br>

<h3><font color="#990000">Trans-Washington Supported Bike Tour</font></h3>
<p>Garry Kehr (former President of COGS) has invited COGS to collaborate with the Spokane Bicycle Club for a bike trip across Washington State this summer. This collaboration has resulted in a six day ride event from Seattle to Spokane along scenic Highway 2. <strong>The event is scheduled for June 16 to 21, 2014.</strong> The <a href="PDFs/TransWashingtonTour2014.pdf">flyer</a> and the info below has information about the Tour. If you are interested I encourage you to register early for the trip in that the Tour will be capped by how many lodging arrangements can be made in several of the small towns in which the participants will be staying the night.</p>
<p> 
Here are the particulars for the Trans-Washington Supported Bike Tour:
</p> 
<p>
<li><strong>Ride Description:</strong> Ride will originate at Gas Works Park in Seattle on the morning of June 16th and proceed along Highway 2 arriving in Spokane on June 21st. The route is 337.4 miles in length. Gary has ridden the route several times and advises the route is a beautiful one. There will be layovers in the following towns along the way: Skykomish, Leavenworth, Waterville, Coulee City and Davenport. The final route for the Tour will be finalized by mid- February. Gary will then provide a list of hotels and camp grounds the Tour will be using.
</li>
</p> 
<p>
<li><strong>Ride Leaders:</strong> Tour is a collaboration between Spokane Bicycle Club and Cyclist of Greater Seattle Club. Gary Kehr of Spokane Bike Club is the principal ride leader. Tom Tanner will be the COGS support person.
</li>
</p> 
<p>
<li><strong>Who May Participate:</strong> Participants must be a member of either the Spokane Bicycle Club or the Cyclist of Greater Seattle Club. Of course, you may invite your non COGS friends and have then sign up for COGS membership and they may participate in the Tour. Spokane Bicycle Club participants will bus to Seattle on June 15th and join with COGS participants the morning of June 16th to commence the Tour.
</li> 
</p> 
<p>
<li><strong>How to Register:</strong> Go to the Spokane Bicycle Club's website and register <a href=" http://spokanebicycleclub.wildapricot.org/Default.aspx?pageId=1763453&eventId=817682&EventViewMode=EventDetails">here</a>. Note there is no cost for registering. The Spokane Bike Club website is very easy to use for registering for the ride. Additionally, please drop me a note advising of your interest. I will be helping Gary facilitate lodging and transportation issues for the event.
</li>
</p> 
<p>
<li><strong>Transportation Back to Seattle from Spokane:</strong> Participants will have several options. 1.) Take a 5 hour Greyhound bus back to Seattle from Spokane. Gary will arrange to have cardboard bike boxes and packing materials available in Spokane for participants so you can box your bike and bring it back with you on the bus. Approximate cost is $81 ($51 for your bus ticket and $30 for bike in a box handling fees). 2.) Fly back with your bike in a box provided by Gary. 3.) Take the train back. However, be aware the train schedule for Seattle departs Spokane in the middle of the night. Bus transportation may be the best option unless you need to get back to Seattle quickly then flying is the better option.  Participants will be responsible for making their own transportation arrangements. We will arrive in Spokane in time for Seattle participants to take a Greyhound bus back to Seattle the afternoon of June 21st.
</li>
</p> 
<p>
<li><strong>SAG Support:</strong> Gary's wife and another Spokane Bicycle Club member will provide SAG support throughout the Tour transporting your bags from town to town. Participants will be asked to share in the gas costs. SAG drivers will be volunteering their time and the use of their vehicles.
</li>
</p> 
<p>
<li><strong>Lodging Arrangements:</strong> Participants may elect to camp or stay in motels or so some combination of both. Participants will be responsible for making their own arrangements. Gary and I will work with participants to help facilitate camping and/or motel logistics. Gary will advise of the motels and camping locations in the mid February timeframe that will be used however it will be incumbent on participants to make their own reservations and payment arrangements. Note there are very limited motel rooms available in Coulee City and Davenport suggesting that one commit early to the tour so as to assure their preferred motel/camping arrangements.
</li>
</p> 
<p>
<li><strong>Food Along the Way:</strong> Participants will live off the land - that is eat at restaurants/grocery stores or whatever suits you. Attempts will be made to organize evenings together at local restaurants.
</li>
</p> 
<p>
<li><strong>Cost of the Tour:</strong> The Tour is designed to be a low cost Tour with participants paying their way as they go. Expected expenses: shared gas cost for SAG vehicles, your camping/motel costs, eating costs, transportation back to Seattle, and fun money expenditures.
</li>
</p> 
<p>
<li><strong>Pace of Tour:</strong> Pace of riding will be up to you. The route does include some mountain passes. See the attached flyer for distances to be covered each day. The Tour will be conducted for Fun, Friend and Adventure in keeping with COGS motto.
</li>
