<p>PROS is a Labor Day ride around the City of Seattle's perimeter, literally. Water views and lofty hills dominate the route: 80 miles and 4,200 feet of gain. There is a shorter option of 60 miles and 2,700' which eliminates the challenges of Seattle's northern border.
</p>
<p>The ride begins at Discovery Park and proceeds in a counter-clockwise direction, with three food stops for the full route and two for the short route, including a snack stop in Tukwila at about the 25-mile point, a no-host stop at Leschi and a snack stop at Matthews Beach.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Distance:</strong> About 80 miles for the full PROS, 56 for PROS Lite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cue Sheet:</strong> Copies will be provided at the start.&nbsp; Or <a title="" target="null" href="COGSContentPages/CuesAndMaps/PROS2011CueSheet.pdf">download here</a>, and see the course map at <a title="" href="http://www.bikely.com/maps/bike-path/COGS-PROS-Perimeter-Ride-of-Seattle">Bikely.com</a>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><strong>$20 suggested donation per rider</strong> will be accepted for the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bicyclealliance.org/">Bicycle Alliance of Washington</a> to help make Washington a safe place to ride. There is no pre-registration for this ride.

<p><strong>History:</strong> After six years, PROS has become a classic that is a &quot;must&quot; for Northwest cyclists. Started by Gary Strauss and Dan Wakefield in 2005, and modeled after other perimeter rides such as El Tour de Tucson, PROS circumscribes the city, following a clockwise route from the start at Discovery Park. Seattle's hilly and ravine-divided landscape makes for a challenging but very rewarding ride. You will see Seattle from all sides, including spectacular city, mountain and lake views. As in previous years, instead of using &quot;Dan Henry&quot; route markers there will be a cue sheet and ride leaders for multiple groups at several paces. A &quot;PROS Light&quot; route of 56 miles will also be available. There are two snack stops, at Tukwila and Matthews beach, and a no-host lunch stop at Leschi. There is no SAG vehicle support on this ride, so riders should be self-sufficient. Bring two tubes, a patch kit, pump and basic tools.
</p>
<p><strong>Directions to Start:</strong> From either Ballard or downtown Seattle, take 15th West, Exit to West Emerson onto Gilman Way, which becomes Government Way. Continue to the Discovery Park Entrance and go through the park past the Visitor Center. Take a right following signs to get to North Parking Lot. Also see signs to Daybreak Star.
