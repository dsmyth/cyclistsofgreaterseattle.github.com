<p>PROS is a Labor Day ride around the City of Seattle's perimeter, literally. Water views and lofty hills dominate the route. The full PROS route entails 80 miles and 4,200 feet of elevation gain. PROS Lite is a shorter option of 60 miles and 2,700 feet of elevation gain, which eliminates the challenges of Seattle's northern border.
</p>
<p>The ride begins at Discovery Park and proceeds in a counter-clockwise manner, with two snack stops and lunch for the full route and one snack stop and lunch for the short route. Prepare yourselves for the challenge!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Distance:</strong> About 80 miles for the full PROS, 60 for PROS Lite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cue Sheet:</strong> Copies will be provided at the start.&nbsp; Or <a title="" target="null" href="COGSContentPages/CuesAndMaps/PROS2013CueSheet.pdf">download here</a>. You can also access the tracks at <a target="_blank" href="http://ridewithgps.com/events/PROS">Ride With GPS</a></p><br/>

<p><strong>History:</strong> After seven years, PROS has become a classic that is a &quot;must&quot; for Northwest cyclists. Started by Gary Strauss and Dan Wakefield in 2005, and modeled after other perimeter rides such as El Tour de Tucson, PROS circumscribes the city, following a clockwise route from the start at Discovery Park. Seattle's hilly and ravine-divided landscape makes for a challenging but very rewarding ride. You will see Seattle from all sides, including spectacular city, mountain and lake views. As in previous years, instead of using &quot;Dan Henry&quot; route markers there will be a cue sheet and ride leaders for multiple groups at several paces. A &quot;PROS Lite&quot; route of 60 miles will also be available. There are snack stops at Tukwila and Twin Ponds Park, and a no-host lunch stop at Leschi. There is no SAG vehicle support on this ride, so riders should be self-sufficient. Bring two tubes, a patch kit, pump and basic tools.
</p><br/>
<p><strong>Directions to Start:</strong> From either Ballard or downtown Seattle, take 15th West, Exit to West Emerson onto Gilman Way, which becomes Government Way. Continue to the Discovery Park Entrance and go through the park past the Visitor Center. Take a right following signs to get to North Parking Lot. Also see signs to Daybreak Star.
