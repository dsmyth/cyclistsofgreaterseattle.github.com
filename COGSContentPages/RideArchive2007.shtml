Ride Description:&nbsp; A training ride from West Seattle, scheduled for evenings during the spring, summer and fall, 'between the vernal and autumnal equinox'. There are no cue sheets, we regroup often at major turns in the routes, so not to leave someone behind lost in a neighborhood that they maybe unfamiliar with. We do not ride pacelines and we are not a stay together ride either, however we all do ride at a similar pace and therefore we do stay together most of the time. Most of the riders who ride know the routes and are welcome to go off the front and have as much fun as they care to.&nbsp; Be prepared to handle your minor mechanical problems, flat tires etc. Lights are recommended but not required.&nbsp; We will try to&nbsp; finish before dark. Bring sufficient drinks and extra food for a two to three hour ride.&nbsp; <br />

Ride Leader:&nbsp; Monica Zaborac&nbsp; 206-226-8514 (cell)<br />
Ride Description:&nbsp; A great Ramrod/Rapsody training ride.&nbsp; For those wanting breakfast close to the start of the ride, meet at the Pancake House at Snoqualmie Pass for breakfast at 7:00 am, otherwise ride will start at approximately 8:30 am in Cle Elum.&nbsp; Rain in Seattle doesn't mean it will be raining in Cle Elum.&nbsp; Route will take us over scenic Blewett, formerly Swauk Pass.&nbsp; We'll descend into Leavenworth for lunch.&nbsp; Route back will take us over &quot;old&quot; Blewett Pass.&nbsp; Dessert stop at Mineral Springs Restaurant before the final descent and headwinds into Cle Elum.&nbsp; Expect 6000 feet of climbing on this ride.&nbsp; Be prepared to be self sufficient as ride leader will not stop for mechanical break downs. Take Cle Elum exit and bakery is 2 miles or so down the main road at 1st and Peoh. When you see the Dairy Queen on the right, the bakery is just a block away on the corner on the left side of the street. Please note:&nbsp; Only call the ride leader if you have questions about the route.&nbsp; Do not call about the weather as ride leader will only cancel the ride if it's actually raining in Cle Elum at 8:30 am!&nbsp; Last year, it rained on the drive to Cle Elum, but stopped by the time the ride started.<br />

Terrain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some pretty good hills.<br />
Ride Details:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This ride explores some of the lesser travelled Bellevue roads to Marymoor and then through mostly backroads to Redmond. We then loop back to Kirkland and to Bellevue. It's actually a very charming ride. Be prepared for weather changes. Please check your tires and bike condition before leaving home. Bring at least 2 new tubes, tire levers, a patch kit, and a pumpor CO2 cartridges. Have food but may stop for a snack. Cue sheet provided (no maps). Please do not join us if you are under a lot of time pressure. This is afall ride for fun and smiles. If you come, you can elect to go out on your own at the start. The ride leader will hand you the cue sheet and wish you well. Otherwise, if you start with the group, you are expected to stay more or less with the group for the duration of the ride - including stopping at regrouping points and waiting on top of hills for others. This is not a race or very strenuously paced ride, although the group pace may exceed the stated pace attimes. Not really a good ride for beginners, but intermediate riders should fitin, if they are still riding. If you are pressed for time, please consider other rides, as we will regroup as needed. However, if you are unable to reach the ride leader within 10 minutes of regrouping, you may be dropped. Be prepared for weather changes - yep that means rain. <br />
