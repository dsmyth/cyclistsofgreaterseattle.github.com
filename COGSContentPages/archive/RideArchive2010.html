A coffee and warm-up stop will be about mid-ride. Please park on the street (175th)&nbsp; to the East of Logboom park so we don't use up the limited space in the parking lot.

<strong>Ride Leader: </strong>Bill Leyrer Cell: (206) 226-8102<br />
<br />I'm all for sanity. So at the risk of being chastised for mixing a small bit of politics with a moderate/brisk Saturday (Oct 30th) morning ride, I will lead anyone that shows up, down to Westlake Center. We will make a 30 minute stop at the <a title="" target="_self" href="http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/dailyweekly/2010/09/rally_in_spirit_with_jon_stewa.php">Seattle Rally To Restore Sanity</a>. Then we will continue down to the waterfront and north for some quiet Magnolia streets (and optional hills) with a final stop for pie and conversation in Magnolia Village before closing the loop. We should be back before noon with about 30 miles behind us. The weather forecast currently calls for a chance of showers (50%). I'll probably show up rain or shine.</p>

<h3>Monday, September 6th The Sixth Annual Perimeter Ride of Seattle (PROS).</h3>
<p><strong>Time:</strong> 8:00 for 8:30 start<strong><br />
Distance:</strong> About 80 miles for the full PROS, 56 for PROS Lite.<strong><br />
Pace:</strong> Moderate to brisk.<strong><br />
Leader: </strong>Several ride leaders and paces to be organized.<strong><br />
Cue Sheet: </strong>To be provided at the start and on line here.</p>
COGS and the Bicycle Alliance presents the 2010 version of PROS, a circuit ride around the City of Seattle. <br />
This year there will be a snack stop in Tukwila at about the 25 mile point. <br />
After five years PROS has become a classic that is a &quot;must&quot; for Northwest cyclists. Started by Gary Strauss and Dan Wakefield in 2005, and modeled after other perimeter rides such as El Tour de Tucson, PROS circumscribes the city, following a clockwise route from the start at Discovovery Park. Seattle's hilly and ravine divided landscape makes for a challenging but very rewarding ride. You will see Seattle from all sides, including spectacular city, mountain and lake views.

As in previous years, instead of using dan henry route markers there will be a cue sheet and ride leaders for multiple groups at several paces. A &quot;PROS Light&quot; route of 56 miles will also be available. Other than the Tukwila snack stop, the ride is not supported, and there will be on SAG, so you will need to be self-sufficient. Bring two tubes, a patch kit, pump and basic tools. Groups typically stop for a casual restaurant lunch at Leschi on Lake Washington.

There is a map and cue sheet on Bikely but it is for the original route. A new sheet will be posted before the ride, so check back.

Directions to Start: From either Ballard or downtown Seattle, take 15th West,  Exit to West Emerson onto Gilman Way, which becomes Government Way.  Continue to the Discovery Park Entrance and go through the park past the Visitor Center. Take a right following signs to get to North Parking Lot. Also see signs to Daybreak Star.

Donations accepted for the Bicycle Alliance's work to make Washington State a safe place to ride.

Saturday, July 17 (changed from the 10th due to closure on I-405) Summer Ride for Pie </h3>
<p>Meet: 9 am, Black Diamond Bakery, 32805 Railroad Avenue, directions from Seattle here- allow ~45 minutes Start: 9:15 am <br />
Distance: 50 miles <br />
Terrain: some hills, with one long climb <br />
Pace: Moderate-Low Brisk <br />
Pie: two stops, Black Diamond and Enumclaw <br />
Cue Sheet: <a href="http://www.bikely.com/maps/bike-path/COGS-Ride-for-Pie-Southend">http://www.bikely.com/maps/bike-path/COGS-Ride-for-Pie-Southend</a><br />
Leader: Louise, <a href="mailto:louise.kornreich@gmail.com">louise.kornreich@gmail.com</a> <br />
If you want to eat pie at the Black Diamond Bakery, your best bet is to start a ride there, purchase your pie first and pick it up when you finish the ride. We'll go from Black Diamond, north to Ravensdale, then east and south through old mining towns to make our way to Enumclaw, but not until we do a little climbing to really give you an appetite. There's good pie in Enumclaw and, if you're doing RAMROD this year, you'll want to scout it out for your post-event calorie re-load. From Enumclaw, it's all backroads and farms and lakes, plus the Green River Gorge(ous) back to Black DIamond where, if you thought ahead, you'll have pie waiting for you. </p>

<h3>June 13th - Sunday 2010; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hurricane Ridge with Tom Tanner</h3>
<h3>Our Annual Hurricane Ridge Challenge Ride sponsored by COGS and WSCC.</h3>
<p><strong>Ride Description</strong>:<br />
The ride length is 80 miles with roughly 6200 feet of climbing. The ride starts in Sequim and we warm up biking across to the Olympic National Park entrance for Hurricane Ridge. After a brief regroup for potty and water, we will climb the 17 miles up to the ridge and enjoy lunch at the top. The descent down is thrilling and after we depart the Park we will catch the Olympic Discovery Trail for the trip back to Sequim. This is a challenging but stunningly beautiful ride designed for those seeking to have fun, stay more or less together and provide mutual support. Cheers and good smiles always welcomed.&nbsp; The ride up and down the ridge offers spectacular views and vistas. The scenery along the way is terrific. It should also be noted the roughly 17 miles of road up to the Ridge was repaved a year or so ago. Lee Derror's characterization from last year: &quot;the road from the pay station to the top of hurricane is a dream come true... NEW, CLEAN pavement.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Start Time / Location</strong><u>:</u>&nbsp; <br />
June 13, 2010 -Sunday starting about 9 AM at the Sequim High School parking lot (601 N. Sequin Ave, Sequim). Seattle riders take the 7:10 AM Edmonds Ferry!! After getting off the ferry, drive over to Sequim's High School. We will plan to leave shortly after all the cars carrying riders arrive from the Edmond's ferry at about 9AM.</p>
<p><strong>Car Pooling</strong><u>:</u> <br />
For Seattle riders let's maximize car pooling. If you don't have a car pool, consider sending a COGS email seeking a ride or volunteering to drive. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Optional Start Time / Location</strong><u>:</u> <br />
For those who wish to skip the warm up ride, meet at the Visitor Center in Port Angeles. The riders from Sequim will arrive at approximately 10 AM. From there we can all start climbing from the Visitor Center at the bottom of Hurricane Ridge.</p>
<p><strong>Pace</strong><u>:</u> <br />
Moderate to brisk -&nbsp;let's have a fun pace set by the riding skills of the participants. The regrouping strategy and cue sheets for this ride facilitate riding skills from moderate to brisk. However, one should be able to sustain a long 5000+ foot climb to successful enjoy this ride. The climb up Hurricane Ride will be at each rider's individual pace.&nbsp; Some riders will more quickly ascend; others will just take their time and eventually crest the top.</p>
<p><strong>Regroup</strong>: <br />
We will ride about 20 miles from Sequim to the Hurricane Visitors Station at the foot of the climb. There we will regroup including a potty break and fill our water bottles. At the top of Hurricane Ridge we will regroup for lunch and to share stories of our climb. After lunch we will descend back to the Visitors Center and regroup again before heading back to Sequim via the Olympic Discovery Trail. The trail is a scenic but hilly trail with lots of small hills and rolling terrain to ride through. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cue Sheets</strong>: <br />
Yes, they will be provided.</p>
<p><strong>Equipment</strong>: <br />
Bring two water bottles. You will need both of them for the climb up to the ridge. Bring some energy food to fuel yourself during the climb. Also bring rain and cold weather riding gear. The weather can change quickly up on the Ridge, i.e. turn cold and wet quickly, and the descent requires warm gear if the weather is wet, cool or cold. Remember also you are riding in a rain forest...don't get caught unprepared. Also bring the typical pump, spare tubes and other biking gear to make yourself self sufficient. Money will be needed to pay for your Park entrance fee and for lunch at the top. This is an unsupported ride.</p>
<p><strong>Rain Policy</strong>: <br />
Heavy rain cancels. If in doubt call one of the ride leaders.</p>

The weather forecast is looking “good” for bike riding this coming Sunday, June 6th. Martha Hines and I are planning to do the Peninsula Century ride. Details about the ride are at the above website. We plan to do the full 100 mile, 7500 feet of climbing Century ride.</p>
<p>We have done the ride in the past. It is a tough century with a good deal of climbing and distance to cover through some beautiful country. It is the perfect “training ride” for anyone doing the Bicycle Tour of Colorado, RAMROD, STP or any of the many other challenging adventures us crazy people sign up to do this time of the year.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Our plan is to catch the Sunday, June 6th, 7:50 AM ferry in Fauntleroy to get us over to the starting point at Southworth. Please consider joining in on the fun and participating with us on this ride.</p>
<p>It is too late to pre-register on line but you can still register the day of the ride at the Southworth starting location.</p>

<p>Ride Description:<br />
A great Ramrod/Rapsody training ride. Rain in Seattle doesn’t mean it will be raining in Cle Elum. Route will take us over scenic Blewett, formerly Swauk Pass. We’ll descend into Leavenworth for lunch. Route back will take us over “old” Blewett Pass. Dessert stop at Mineral Springs Restaurant before the final descent and headwinds into Cle Elum. Expect 6000 feet of climbing on this ride. Be prepared to be self sufficient as ride leader will not stop for mechanical break downs. Come prepared with at least 2 new tubes, a patch kit, and a pump or CO2 cartridges. Take Cle Elum exit and bakery is 2 miles or so down the main road at 1st and Peoh. When you see the Dairy Queen on the right, the bakery is just a block away on the corner on the left side of the street. Please note: Call the ride leader ONLY if you have questions about the route. Do not call about the weather as ride leader will only cancel the ride if it’s actually raining in Cle Elum at 8:30 am! Last 2 out of 4 years, it rained on the drive to Cle Elum, but stopped by the time the ride started. This is a joint ride with Cascade Bicycle Club. No cue sheet as there's only a couple turns on the route, but a partial cue sheet will be provided to those who want the backroads (last 10 miles) back to Cle Elum to bypass some of the headwinds.</p>
