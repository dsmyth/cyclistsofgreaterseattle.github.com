<H2>Ride Information</H2>

<HR>
All riders <B>must wear helmets</B> on Seattle Bicycle Club Rides
and are expected to obey the rules of the road, including
showing proper etiquette towards cars, bikes and pedestrians. 
Riders who do not obey traffic rules will be asked to leave.
<P>
Please bring the following along on all rides:  Spare tube and/or patch kit;
pump; ID; $ for food; water!  ID should specify emergency contact name and
phone number, and rider blood type and a list of any allergies and/or specific 
medical needs.  All riders under the age of 18 must be accompanied by a parent 
or responsible adult.
<P>
We encourage you to arrive at the start 15 minutes before the ride,
to sign-in, review the ride map and prep your bicycle.  If you
have any questions about the ride, ask the Ride Leader or one of the 
Ride Leader Assistants before the ride begins -- they are there to
help and advise.
<P>
Our regular club rides are intended for members and their guests,
and for out-of-town visitors to Seattle.  
We do, though, welcome our fellow Puget Sounders to take a club ride to
audition us -- we're sure if you ride with us, you'll want to be part of
our club. 
<P>
<I>Those who participate in Weekend Touring Events must be SBC members.</I>
