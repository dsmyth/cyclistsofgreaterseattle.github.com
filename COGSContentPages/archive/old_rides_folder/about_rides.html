<h1 style="text-align: center">2008 Rides Program&nbsp;</h1>
<h1 style="text-align: center">Something for everyone (who rides a bike).</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal">Responding to requests of club members, the COGS board has&nbsp;organized a series of rides that cover the range from the occasional Saturday outing up to preparation for&nbsp;an ambitious mountain tour. We have brought back the rides that were successful in the past and added some new ones. All rides will be posted on the COGS web site, so check regularly for updates. </p>
<h2>Weekly Gasworks Rides. </h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">The popular <strong>Wednesday Night</strong> 6:30 PM series continues. This brisk outing provides a mid-week work out for those ready for urban hills and dark streets. Riders typically meet at the start time to&nbsp;select a route for then evening before leaving. Usually followed by dinner and socialzing at a local eatery. If there is interest, we may add moderate series when the evenings get longer and warmer.</p>
<h2>Weekend Day Rides</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">We have a number of riders who enjoy leading rides in our local area. These are typically 40 to 70 miles at a moderate or brisk pace. They follow scenic rural routes in King and neighboring counties, within an hour’s drive from <?xml:namespace prefix = st1 />
<st1:city w:st="on">
<st1:place w:st="on">Seattle</st1:place></st1:city>. These series offers a way to log more mileage and see new roads with a compatible group of COGS riders. Usually a lunch stop is included. Expect to see these rides posted a week or two ahead of time on the COGS Upcoming Rides page, led by Bob Nyberg, Louise Kornreich, Mark Peterson, Gary Strauss and others.</p>
<h2>COGS Training series</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">This popular series for those with ambitious riding goals is back this year. Thanks go Tom Tanner, for leading the effort to assemble a weekly schedule that runs from March through August. The series adds miles and altitude as the season progresses to help you prepare for a one-day STP, the RAMROD or similar challenges. The series includes our own club rides such as
<st1:place w:st="on">
<st1:placename w:st="on">Hood</st1:placename>
<st1:placetype w:st="on">Canal</st1:placetype></st1:place> and Mt Rainer, and mixes in COGS-lead-groups participating at sponsored events such as the Yakima Ridges Ride and Tour de Kitsap. The full schedule is posted on our web site, and will be updated as the year progresses</p>
<h2>COGS
<st1:place w:st="on">
<st1:city w:st="on">Tours</st1:city></st1:place></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">The COGS tours continue this year with multi-day outings that emphasize camaraderie as much as cycling. Organized by Mary Jo Gerst, the tours include outings to the south sound,
<st1:place w:st="on">Eastern Washington</st1:place> and other scenic areas.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
