<p>Our great hosts in Granite Falls wrote us recently: </p>
<p>Hello Gary: </p>
<p>Thought I should give you an update about the mountain loop. I drove to Barlow Pass this afternoon to check the road conditions. The roadway is in great shape, blacktop all the way to Barlow. The road however is still currently closed at Barlow. I know they are close coming from the Darrington side so I only think a couple more days before the loop is completely open. I tried to pretend that I was a bicyclist heading to Barlow. I noticed that the road bed grade stays fairly constant, 1 - 2 % average grade to about the Big Four picnic area (about MP 24 coming from Granite). Then the grade appears to change to about 4 - 5 % grade on up to Barlow (MP 30). The temp only dropped about 5 degrees from Granite to Barlow which surprised me. 56 degrees to 51 degrees (June ?) All in all, I have a feeling you and your group have ridden on far worse roads in the past. The website is up and running if you wouldn't mind passing it on again. www.mountainloopexperience.com. If in the next week you get kind of a feel for how many people you think might show, would you pass it on to me please. I want to make sure that you guys have something to eat and drink when you get to Barlow. [I told the organizers that we usually don't get much of a count. However, if any of you wish to let me know if you are coming I will pass the information on.] I believe whomever shows to ride will have a good time back in town at the celebration. The events are coming together and we have more vendors than I thought we would get on such short notice. The website has a pretty good description of what is happening. You guys are great. I wish our Chamber could be this together. What kind of drinks (water, pop juice) would be the best at the top? I know that we are getting water donated and some pop, so we could have that available when you reach the end. I believe the food list would be limited but I will do our best to accommodate your needs. Please tell me what would be fairly good energy and could be served cold. At this time our sponsorship is limited, probably from being the first time for the event, but I'm being optimistic that it will come around. I will keep you updated on how much and what kind of food will be available. I am planning that the local police will be setup to assist the riders as they leave the start area until they turn onto Alder which becomes the Mountain Loop. We have a great police chief with some young energetic go getters. At this time, I wasn't planning on traffic control when you come back, unless you tell me differently. Your club's presence at the ceremony will be good press for your club. Ribbon Cutting Ceremony / Granite Falls June 28, 2008: MOUNTAIN LOOP TO HOPEFULLY REOPEN BEFORE JUNE 28TH. A group of dignitaries from the National Forest Service Department, State, County &amp; local governments will travel via antique steam engine 12 passenger cart to Barlow Pass. At 12:00 noon a ribbon cutting ceremony will take place to officially signify the re-opening of the Mountain Loop Highway. The Cascade Bicycle Club is holding a Bike to Barlow bike run from Granite to Barlow Pass. Come along, be a spectator and help us celebrate this historic event. Nature can keep us away for awhile, but the beauty keeps calling us back. </p>
