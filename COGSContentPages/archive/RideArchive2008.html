December 21st is the Winter Solstice which means it's the first day of winter
and also the shortest day of the year. Why celebrate? Well, that means the days
start getting longer on Dec 22 and why not commemorate it by riding into the
longest night of the year! We will stop for hot chocolate and snacks and will
undoubtedly see some lights from that other December holiday.<br />

Start at:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:30 a.m. sharp - that is
when the ferry leaves. Total fare is $4.95 including $1 bike surcharge. Cue
sheets will be on my the windshield of my Green Subaru Outback - Bike Plate
1379<br />
Pace:<span>&nbsp; </span>15-18 mph avg or so. Climb at own
pace and regroup on top of hills.<br />
Regroup:<span>&nbsp; </span>From time to time per cue
sheet, leader's direction and on top of hills<br />
Ride Distance:<span>&nbsp; </span>About 130 miles<br />
Ride Leaders: Gary Strauss - prefer email contact at garystrauss@gmail.com (day
of ride cell 206-948-9024; day phone during week 206-816-1300; home
206-937-1852).<span>&nbsp; </span>Ed Razon -
ed_razon@comcast.net cell ( 206) 235-1372.<span>&nbsp;</span>Some of you have offered to help co-lead. Please confirm via email and
preferred pace to lead. If enough riders show up, we may have a faster and a
more moderate group. If you want to co-lead, you must agree to follow the
entire cue sheet and not &quot;do your own thing!&quot; <br />
Rain Policy:<span>&nbsp; </span>Really bad weather cancels.
We will go if it is sprinkling. If weather turns bad, we will consider turning
around.<span>&nbsp; </span><br />
Terrain:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Very Hilly. Lots of climbing!<br />
Cue Sheet:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes.<br />
Ride Details:<span>&nbsp; </span>We are leaving on the 730
a.m. ferry, so get there at least 30 minutes early to get your ticket. I will
leave cue sheets on my green Subaru Outback. This is the classic century plus.
We are doing this route clockwise - so bring money for the ferry. The ride
heads north up Whidbey, crosses Deception Pass, and then travels from La Connor
back to Mukilteo. A very challenging, hilly and beautiful ride. Be prepared for
weather changes and to do a lot of climbing. This ride is not being offered for
beginner riders, someone not in shape to ride 130 miles or those who feel a
club ride is a race. You are welcome to pick up a cue sheet and do the ride on
your own. However, if you join the group, the leader expects you to stay in
touch with the group. If you are unable to keep up within about 5-10 minutes of
the leader at regrouping spots, you will be dropped. Bring at least 2-3 new
tubes, tire levers, a patch kit, and a pump or CO2 cartridges. Have plenty of
food and water with you, but we will stop from time to time to regroup and to
eat. Recommend using a camelbak on this ride. Please check your tires and bike
condition before leaving home. Don't fail to replace your tires if it is time
to do so or if you have had 2 or more flats. There is little support on the
Island. This ride will take most of the day, depending upon conditions, group
size, length of breaks, etc., so please do not join us if you are under a lot
of time pressure.<br />

mountain - go figure!<br />

route is out and back.<br />
Ride Details: A very challenging beautiful ride that rises to the top of Artist
Point past the Mt. Baker Ski Area for a climb of around 6000 feet total (4800
to the summit approximately). This is one of the really great climbing routes
in Washington. Be prepared for mountain weather changes. Bring at least 2-3 new
tubes, tire levers, a patch kit, and a pump or CO2 cartridges. Have plenty of
food and water. Unless you stop at or around the small towns on the way up or
back, not much food or water. Consider using a camelbak on this ride. Please check
your tires and bike condition before leaving home. Everyone is pretty much on
his/her own. Consider carrying a camera - on a sunny day, the views are
unbelievable on this ride - like being in the Alps.<span>&nbsp; </span>We start around 440 feet and ride to about
5080 feet if you trust the DeLormo Topo map.<br />

Ride Description:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Mountain Loop
Experience Committee invited CBC to help support its celebration of the
reopening of Mountain Loop Hwy. This is a tri-cities effort by Darrington,
Arlington and Granite Falls. We will climb from Granite Falls, elevation 452
feet, to the end of the newly paved Mtn. Loop Hwy at Monte Cristo over Barlow
Pass at 2,361 feet above sea level. Barlow Pass was named for J.Q. Barlow who
surveyed a route up the South Fork of the Stillaguamish River for the Everett
&amp; Monte Cristo Ry in 1891-92. This was also the site of the Barlow Pass
Ranger Station. If you wish, at your sole option and responsibility, you can
hike the trail to the Old Monte Cristo town site, a 4-mile dirt road to Monte
Cristo that mountain bikes can traverse. The road follows the old railroad
grade so it is an easy family walk. We will begin the ride at the brand new GF
High School. Depart SR-9 on SR-92 heading East; turn left (NW) on 84th St NE
[Getchell Rd], and then turn right (N) on 163rd Ave NE and right (E) on 100th
St NE [also n/a Burn Rd]. We will leave promptly at 9:00 a.m. in order to get
to the ribbon cutting ceremony by 12 noon. You will ride at your own level, and
there will be no sweep. This will not be a stay together ride, but you will be
provided a cue sheet. Be at the start by 8:30 a.m. If you feel you need to
start even earlier, I will provide you a cue sheet and sign in at 8:30 a.m., as
MLEC and CBC want to encourage you to do this ride. The ride is an &#8220;up&#8221; and
&#8220;down&#8221; route, with some side roads to/from the High School. Since there is no
set pace, you are welcome to join us if you are comfortable doing a fairly long
climb up not that steep a road. Be sure to come prepared for weather changes in
a mountain environment and bring food. There will be fun activities in the area
on the day of the ride. Information about the event will be posted on MLEC&#8217;s
web site when it is ready. Background about the Mountain Loop Hwy can be found
at http://www.visitoldgrowth.com/ MtnLoopHiway.htm.<br />

Saturday, June 28th Hills of Ramrod.<br />
Ride start:<span>&nbsp; </span>Greenwater, on Hwy 410. <br />
Start time:<span>&nbsp; </span>9:00 a.m. <br />
Distance:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>80 Miles or so.<br />
Terrain:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two or three really big
hills.<br />
Park at:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ski shop just east of
Greenwater.<span>&nbsp; </span><br />
Ride Leader:<span>&nbsp; </span>Ken Winkenweder
winkie@netos.com <br />
Ride Description:<span>&nbsp; </span>This is an SBC
Training Series ride. It follows the route of the 2007 Ramrod, although doing
only about half the distance (but most of the climbing). We'll ride up to
Sunrise, then back to the highway and up to Chinook. On the way down, an option
for those who want to is to ride up to Crystal ski area. Ken claims he will be
too worn out to do that, but no one can recall actually seeing Ken worn out. <br />
<br />
Here are three reasons to do this ride - Because it's an out-and-back route,
you can choose to do one or two or all three climbs, as you feel inclined. The
Sunrise climb is spectacular, and is not to be missed. Greenwater is a great
start point - it's close to the mountain, yet far enough away from Sunrise to
get warmed up, and only about a 90 minute drive from Seattle.<br />
