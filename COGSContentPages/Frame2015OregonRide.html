            <p>COGS is offering a beautiful seven day bike tour in the center of Oregon starting and finishing in Salem, Oregon from August 15th to 22nd, 2015. This description outlines what promises to be a fun-filled and adventuresome COGS bike tour.</p>
            <br>
            <p>COGS has again requested Ralph and Carol &mdash; long time COGS members, who for the past 14 years have been organizing and leading professional style bike tours as volunteers around the country &mdash; to coordinate and lead the Oregon Tour. This will be their third tour for COGS. They have agreed to do so at cost. They will be our ride leaders and will make all the tour arrangements including providing cue sheets and maps for each day along with lots of ideas for interesting things to do en route.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This tour takes in the heart of Oregon, enjoying some of the best scenery Oregon has to offer on both sides of the Cascade Mountains &mdash; hence the name Oregon Over and Back Tour. We start in the beautiful Willamette Valley in Salem Oregon and head up to Silverton on the slopes of the Cascades staying at the gorgeous Oregon Gardens Resort. We then pass by Silver Falls State Park on our way to start our climb up Santiam Pass and stay at Detroit Lake before heading across the pass to Sisters where we will take a day off. On Day 5 we return to the west side of the state, going over the lightly travelled and beautiful Old McKenzie Pass to Eugene. The last two days have us exploring the Willamette Valley as we first ride to Corvallis and finally back to Salem. The daily distances average 65 miles, but vary from 40 to 96 miles. Elevation gains vary from 1100 feet to about 4000 feet. All told, we should end up with nearly 400 miles and 15,000 feet of climbing.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The ride is intended for riders with moderate biking skill levels or better. Everyone can ride at their own comfortable pace. Be aware though that there is a 90 mile day and we will be climbing 3,000 to 4,000 feet on four days. There will be a day off in Sisters. The trip will be supported with a dedicated SAG van and a support truck to haul all of our stuff. If you&#8217;re having an off day or have a mechanical you can always catch a ride in the SAG van. The cost of the tour includes the SAG truck and van as well as motel lodging, snacks and lunch along the way. No camping needed on this trip! Breakfast and dinner are on your own but several motels will be serving breakfast at no additional cost.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The ride is open to COGS members and COGS friends. The ride will be limited to the first 30 riders that sign up. The plan is to fill the tour with COGS riders and their friends. However, if the tour is not full (30 paid up riders) as of January 15th the tour will be opened to non - COGS riders to fill up the tour to ensure all the fixed costs are covered.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The cost of the trip is $895 per participant. This includes the cost of the per diem for the ride leaders and SAG drivers, motels, vehicle support, snacks/lunch and other miscellaneous costs associated with organizing and fielding the trip. 25% ($225) of the cost for each rider will be collected at time of registration and the remainder is due 90 days prior to the event ($670 due no later than May 15th). Go <a title="COGS Tour Refund Policy" target="_blank" href="COGSContentPages/Forms/COGS%20Tour%20Refund%20Policy.pdf">here</a> to see the COGS Refund/Transfer Policy.</p>
            <br>
            <p>All participants will need to be or become COGS members so that COGS insurance covers everyone on the ride. If you are not a COGS member you must submit an application to join COGS with the annual club dues of $16 when you submit your application and deposit for the ride.</p>
