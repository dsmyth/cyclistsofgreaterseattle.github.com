<h2>Do I have to be a COGS member?</h2>
Anyone who is over 18 and has a bike and a helmet is welcome to come on our rides. Just pick a ride that fits your abilities and show up fifteen minutes before the start time. You don't have to be a member, but if you enjoy riding with us and regularly come on COGS rides, we encourage you to <strong><span style="text-decoration: none">
<a href="COGSContentPages/FrameMemberApp.shtml" title="">join the club</a>
</span></strong> to get all the benefits we offer. If you are under 18 you are still welcome but you will need your parent or guardian's written permission.
<h2>Will I be able to keep up?</h2>
<p class="right">Know your current abilities, and then choose a ride by looking at the pace, distance and terrain that the ride leader has classified. If you want a stress-free, easily handled outing, then stick with a ride that matches your ability. If you want to improve your fitness and skills, then you should choose a ride that is a bit beyond what you have done before. Consider extending your range by 10 - 20% at a time. For instance, if your last ride was a moderate 30 miler, you might consider a moderate 35 miler next week. If you always find yourself at the front of the group, or first to the top of the hill, then consider a brisk ride on your next outing.</p>

<h2>What do the paces mean?</h2>
<p class="right">COGS uses the same pace classification system as Cascade Bike club. The speed, on a flat road and no wind for each pace is:</p>
<p class="right"></p>
<p class="right">Steady / Social: 12-14 mph<br />
Moderate: 14-16 mph<br />
Brisk: 16-18 mph<br />
Strenuous: 18-21 mph<br />
Super Strenuous: 22+ mph<br />
To know your abilities you will need to time yourself or get a bike computer with a speedometer. Pace varies by terrain, of course. A Moderate ride may go up the hills at 6 MPH and down them at 20. For rides described as HILLY, consider choosing a pace one step down from your usual comfort level.&nbsp; </p>

<p class="right"></p>
<h2>What is the &quot;Corner Person&quot; system?</h2>
<p class="right">On rides without cue sheets or on complex routes, the group may get spread out. To keep people from getting lost, the leader may post a rider at each corner to show others the way. When the last person (the sweep) goes by, the corner person rejoins the ride.</p>
<p class="right"></p>
<h2>What should I wear?</h2>
<p class="right">The only mandatory requirement is that you must wear an ANSI approved bike helmet. If you are just getting into bike riding, then wear whatever you are comfortable in. It is better to avoid loose and baggy stuff because that tends to inhibit your movement. Once you go on longer rides (over twenty miles or a couple of hours) you will probably want to get special purpose bike clothes. In the Northwest, on any ride from September through May there is a possibility of rain and cold, so always bring long finger gloves and a <span style="color: #222222; font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 12px; line-height: 20px">water-resistant wind-breaker</span>.</p>
<p class="right"></p>
<h2>What do I Bring?</h2>
<p class="right"></p>
<p class="right">&nbsp;Be minimally self sufficient for the length of ride you are going on. In brief that means&nbsp; our bike must be in good working order, and bring food, drink and tools. Know how to fix a flat, and bring a spare tube and pump. On longer rides (30 miles or more) bring a couple of tubes.&nbsp; For a 20 miler, bring a water bottle. For longer rides bring two water bottles and extra food in the form or a nutrition bar, banana or other convenient sources of protein and carbs. In winter, always have red taillight. If there is any chance of being out after dusk, add a headlight too. Lastly,&nbsp; remember to pump up your&nbsp; tires, and fill your water bottles before leaving home. Most important, COGS members always bring a smile and willingness to get to know new riders - enjoying cycling is what it is all about!</p>
<h2>How do you read a cue sheet?</h2>
<p class="right">Many of our rides will have a cue sheet provided by the leader. If you are finding your way with a cue sheet, it is pretty much a requirement to
have an accurately calibrated bike computer. And - remember to set it
to zero when you start! Following are some common cue sheet abbreviations you will see:</p>
<p class="right">L - Turn Left<br />
R - Turn Right<br />
BL - Bear Left<br />
BR - Bear right<br />
CS - Continue Straight<br />
NC - Name Change of road (or BC - Becomes)<br />
X - Cross<br />
Imd L-&nbsp; Immediate Left.</p>
<p class="right"></p>
<h2>Will I get dropped? </h2>
<p class="right"></p>
<p class="right">On almost all COGS rides of a Brisk or slower pace, the Ride Leader will try to keep the group together. Regroup points at top of hills and major intersections help everyone keep up. Ride leaders often exchange cell phone numbers and do their best to stay in touch with everyone on the ride, but t sis not always possible to do so. On a moderate ride the leader may wait up to 10 minutes at regroup points, but if you are still behind you may get dropped. Consider that at a 15 MPH pace, ten minutes behind means 2.5 miles back. If you are back that far you really should pick an easier pace, the next time out.</p>
<h2>How do I get faster?</h2>
<p class="right">While there is no end to the amount of information you
can get on cycling training, here is a very simple way to improve: just keep riding and gradually add to your mileage. First, try to ride every
weekend (well OK, most of us are lucky to do 3 weekends a month, but
you get the idea). Next, keep challenging yourself by adding distance
and climbing bigger hills. If you start doing 20 miles and increase by 10% a week,
you will be doing a century in less than five months!&nbsp; Lastly, ride at
least once during the week;&nbsp; a midweek ride is the best way to keep from
losing the conditioning you gain on the longer weekend outings.</p>
