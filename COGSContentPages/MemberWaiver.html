      IN CONSIDERATION of being permitted to participate in any way in Cyclists of
      Greater Seattle (“Club”) sponsored Bicycling Activities (“Activity”), I for
      myself, my personal representatives, assigns, heirs, and next of kin: <br>
      <br>
      1. ACKNOWLEDGE, agree, and represent that I understand the nature of
      Bicycling Activities and that I am qualified, in good health, and in proper
      physical condition to participate in such Activity. I further acknowledge
      that the Activity will be conducted over public roads and facilities open to
      the public during the Activity and upon which the hazards of traveling are
      to be expected. I further agree and warrant that if at any time I believe
      conditions to be unsafe, I will immediately discontinue further
      participation in the Activity. <br>
      <br>
      2. FULLY UNDERSTAND that: (a) BICYCLING ACTIVITIES INVOLVE RISKS AND DANGERS
      OF SERIOUS BODILY INJURY, INCLUDING PERMANENT DISABILITY, PARALYSIS AND
      DEATH (“RISKS”); (b) these Risks and dangers may be caused by my own
      actions, or inactions, the actions or inactions of others participating in
      the Activity, the condition in which the Activity takes place, or THE
      NEGLIGENCE OF THE “RELEASEES” NAMED BELOW; (c) there may be OTHER RISKS AND
      SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC LOSSES either not known to me or not readily foreseeable
      at this time; and I FULLY ACCEPT AND ASSUME ALL SUCH RISKS AND ALL
      RESPONSIBILITY FOR LOSSES, COSTS, AND DAMAGES I incur as a result of my
      participation in the Activity. <br>
      <br>
      3. HEREBY RELEASE, DISCHARGE, AND COVENANT NOT TO SUE the Club, their
      respective administrators, directors, agents, officers, members, volunteers,
      and employees, other participants, any sponsors, advertisers, and if
      applicable, owners and lessors of premises on which the Activity takes
      place, (each considered one of the “RELEASEES” herein) FROM ALL LIABILITY,
      CLAIMS, DEMANDS, LOSSES, OR DAMAGES ON MY ACCOUNT CAUSED OR ALLEGED TO BE
      CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGIGENCE OF THE “RELEASEES” OR OTHERWISE,
      INCLUDING NEGLIGENT RESCUE OPERATIONS; AND I FURTHER AGREE that if, despite
      this RELEASE AND WAIVER OF LIABILITY, ASSUMPTION OF RISK, AND INDEMNITY
      AGREEMENT I, or anyone on my behalf, makes a claim against any of the
      Releases, I WILL INDEMNIFY, SAVE, AND HOLD HARMLESS EACH OF THE RELEASEES
      from any litigation expenses, attorney fees, loss, liability, damage, or
      cost which any may incur as the result of such claim.<br>
      <br>
      I HAVE READ THIS AGREEMENT, FULLY UNDERSTAND ITS TERMS, UNDERSTAND THAT I
      HAVE GIVEN UP SUBSTANTIAL RIGHTS BY AGREEING TO IT AND HAVE AGREED TO IT
      FREELY AND WITHOUT ANY INDUCEMENT OR ASSURANCE OF ANY NATURE AND INTEND IT
      TO BE A COMPLETE AND UNCONDITIONAL RELEASE OF ALL LIABILITY TO THE GREATEST
      EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW AND AGREE THAT IF ANY PORTION OF THIS AGREEMENT IS
